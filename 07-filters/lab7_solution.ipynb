Indeed, all physical processing devices (and digital devices in particular) can only deal with a finite range of possible input values before things like distortion or breakdown start to happen, and this nominal input range is usually centered around zero. If a signal is not balanced, it will not be able to fully use the available input range of a processing device.\n",
