    "- What happens if you put two exponentials at the same frequency? \n",
    "- What happens to the orange line if you have one exponential at frequency $f$ and the other one at frequency $-f$? Why is that the case? What does the Fourier transform look like, and what property does it have?\n",
    "- What happens if you change the amplitude of an exponential? \n"
