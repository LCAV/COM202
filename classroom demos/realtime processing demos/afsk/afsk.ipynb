    "# AFSK Data Transmission\n",

    "In this notebook we will implement a fully-functional Binary Frequency Shift Keying data transmission system working in the audio band (hence the \"A\" in AFSK). From Wikipedia:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Frequency-shift keying (FSK) is a frequency modulation scheme in which digital information is transmitted through discrete frequency changes of a carrier signal. [...] The simplest FSK is binary FSK (BFSK) [where] a pair of discrete frequencies transmit binary (0s and 1s) information. With this scheme, the 1 is called the mark frequency and the 0 is called the space frequency. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our implementation the two frequencies are in the audible range and therefore this transmission scheme can be used to send information from a loudspeaker to a microphone if desired. "
