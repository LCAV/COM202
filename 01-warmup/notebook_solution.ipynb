If a finite-length, discrete-time signal is sent over such a channel one sample at a time, a drop-out will result in a complete loss of information for the tail end of the signal. \n",
    "\n",
    "An more robust approach in these cases is to convert the signal into a format that allows for a _progressive decoding_, that is, a format in which every data sample successfully refines the _entire_ signal reconstruction. With this, if the tail end of the data is lost, the received information will be enough to reconstruct a global approximation of the original signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "A length-$N$ discrete-time signal is equivalent to a vector $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ and, when we consider the individual sample values over time, these are in fact the coefficients of the vector's decomposition over the canonical basis for $\\mathbb{R}^N$. The canonical basis vectors are called \"maximally sparse\" because in each vector only one element is nonzero; as a consequence the information they carry is completely localized in the position of the nonzero element.\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain robustness with respect to data loss, we should instead use a basis in which the information carried by every basis vector is spread over all elements of the original signal. Additionally, we would like the basis to decompose a signal in a hyerarchical way, that is, in a way where most of the information is contained in as few basis decomposition coefficients as possible. In this section we will explore one such basis, called the Haar basis."

    "## The Haar basis\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking for a good basis, what we usually want is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    " * we want the basis to be orthonormal (or at least orthogonal) so that basis decomposition is obtained simply via a series of inner products;\n",
    " * we want the basis to be able to represent the signal information robustly so that a few basis vectors can capture most of the information contained in the signal. This will ensure resilence against data loss;\n",
    " * we want the basis to be easy to compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such basis is the **Haar basis**, whose properties and mathematical details are described in detail [here](https://chengtsolin.wordpress.com/2015/04/15/real-time-2d-discrete-wavelet-transform-using-opengl-compute-shader/) for the more interested readers. In a nutshell, the Haar basis provides a *hierarchical* encoding of the information contained in a data vector: \n",
    " * the coefficient for the first basis vector encodes the average value of the data\n",
    " * the coefficient for the second basis vector encodes the difference between the averages of the first half and the second half of the data\n",
    " * every subsequent coefficient encodes a difference between the averages of alternating sets of data points\n",
    " \n",
    "With this encoding, the original data vector can be built incrementally with every additional Haar coefficient, which allows for a partial reconstruction even if some coefficients are not available.\n"
